# PVLSE - Top 5 Hack Outside Hacks 2018
The basis behind the application *Pvlse* is to truly connect music listeners with their music using their heart rate. Initially designed for Twitch 
streamers, whose emotional connection to livestream viewers is quite scarce, Pvlse has the ability to track a user's heart rate and play music 
correlated to that particular heart rate. In this manner, the viewers of the Twitch stream listen to the music, and their heart beats 
change along with those of the player. Now connected through the music, the streamer and the viewers can be connected not just via Twitch but 
also by heart.

## Key Features
**Real-time heart rate detector** - By simply placing one's finger on the sensor on the back of a supporting device, Pvlse can detect their 
heart rate.

**Play song based on bpm** - Using the heart rate from the detector, Pvlse is able to choose a song to play with beats per minute close to the heart rate
of the user.

**Video player** - A video player accompanies the music being played. This feature is implemented in the case that the user desires to 
watch the music video of the song that they are listening to.
